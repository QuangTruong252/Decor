# Project Overview

This is an admin dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses TanStack Query for data fetching, Zustand for state management, and NextAuth.js for authentication. The project is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between components, services, hooks, and stores.
